datacentre --> contains servers
India has 2 data centres --> Mumbai & Hyderabad
configurable computing resources remotely / store , manage and process data --> cloud computing
Refer NIST Definition for cloud computing
SLA --> Service Level Agreement

1. CLoud service Model --> SaaS , PaaS , IaaS 
IaaS --> specificatins given to cloud like we say for laptop we need this much RAM ,GB,etc.
PaaS --> readymade development platform we use OR development environment. Globally accessable , scalable, etc like features.
Saas --> readymade software like APIs , google docs , pdf sites, ChatGPT.

2. Cloud Deplyoment Model --> Public , Hybrid , Community , Public 
Public Cloud --> Pros: duration is less , cheaper , less maintanence ; Cons: bound to follow the rules, use only the available resources ; eg : AWS , GCP
Private Cloud/ On - premises Cloud --> Pros : Security , services that run in my firewall is called on premise cloud.
Hybrid --> Private + Public ; Mostly used ; third party services
Community Cloud --> byjus used only for education.
Multi Cloud --> run single application in aws,gcp and azure for best features
 
3. Essential Characteristics --> 
On-demand self service 
Broad network access 
Resource pooling
Rapid elasticity 
Measured service
Resiliency --> Robust to any failure  

Multi Factor Aunthentiation --> MFA

AWS:
1. Regions contains Az
2. Availibity zones --> Az contains datacentres
3. Edge location less latency of services.

Difference betn GB & GiB.
us-east 1 contains all new services and billing services.

Web servers used to deploy websites :
Ngnix , Apache , Tomcat.
httpd --> d stands for demon service
login --> EC2 instance then launch instance then give name then give OS name use aws amazon linux latest one AMI --> amazon Machine Image (It is imp to reate a machine) ---> select instance type t2 micro --> key pair create new keypair --> RSA --> open ssh coz we are using linux --> Allow SSH and HTTP --> create instance --> Running --> Connect

sudo yum update
sudo yum install httpd -y
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemcpl enable httpd
sudo systemmult status httpd
echo "<html><body><h1> My name is Priya </h1> </body></html>"
/vaz/www/html/index.html/

0.0.0.0/0 --> u can globally open it from anywhere.
